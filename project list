### 🧪 Beginner Raspberry Pi Project Ideas

#### 🔐 1. **Pi-hole Privacy Gateway**  
Block ads and trackers across your network. Great for learning about DNS, privacy, and POPIA-aligned infrastructure.

#### 📡 2. **IoT Sensor Station**  
Connect a temperature or motion sensor and log the data. Perfect for understanding edge-based data collection and POPIA compliance basics.

#### 🧠 3. **AI Image Classifier**  
Use a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model to identify objects from a webcam. Teaches you how AI works on-device—no cloud required.

#### 🔍 4. **Network Scanner**  
Run Nmap to map your home network. Learn how devices communicate and how to spot vulnerabilities—ideal for cybersecurity awareness.

#### 📊 5. **Mini ESG Dashboard**  
Use Node-RED or Grafana to display simple metrics (e.g. energy use, uptime). Introduces visual storytelling and ESG tracking.

#### 🧰 6. **LegalTech FAQ Kiosk**  
Build a touchscreen interface that displays governance FAQs or contract templates. Great for stakeholder education and UX design.

#### 🔒 7. **Fail2ban Firewall Demo**  
Set up fail2ban to monitor login attempts and block suspicious IPs. A hands-on intro to threat detection and response.

#### 🧬 8. **Badge Tracker & Learning Path Host**  
Use GitHub Pages to host a learning path or badge tracker for consultants. Teaches markdown, modular documentation, and stakeholder engagement.

#### 📦 9. **USB Data Logger**  
Log data from a USB device (e.g. barcode scanner or keyboard). Useful for compliance simulations and understanding input/output flows.

#### 🧠 10. **Responsible AI Ethics Quiz**  
Build a simple quiz app that teaches AI ethics and governance principles. Great for workshops or onboarding sessions.

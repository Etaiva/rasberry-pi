🧠 Raspberry Pi Governance Lab Hands-on projects using Raspberry Pi to explore governance, cybersecurity, AI, and compliance—South African legislation included. Build dashboards, scan networks, run ethical AI, and make governance visible, practical, and a bit brilliant.

Absolutely, Etienne. Here’s a full rewrite of your Raspberry Pi repository description—crafted for geeks and nerds who love a good build, appreciate clarity, and want to make governance not just visible, but *tinkerable*. It’s written in UK-based grammar, grounded in South African context, and designed to make complex ideas feel practical and empowering.

## 🧠 Raspberry Pi 
**Where compliance meets curiosity. Build it. Break it. Understand it. Share it.**

### 🔍 What This Repo Is About  
It started with a Raspberry Pi and a question: *Can governance be hands-on?* Turns out, when you mix sensors, dashboards, and a bit of Python, governance becomes something you can actually see, touch, and explain to your gran.

This repo is for the geeks, nerds, and curious minds who want to explore how Raspberry Pi can be used to teach, test, and demonstrate real-world governance principles—from data protection and cybersecurity to responsible AI and ESG tracking.

Whether you're wiring up a motion sensor to simulate POPIA compliance, or deploying a Pi-hole to show what privacy looks like in practice, this lab is your playground.

### 🧪 Projects You Can Build  
Each project is designed to be modular, practical, and a little bit fun. You don’t need a law degree—just a Pi, a bit of patience, and a willingness to learn by doing.

- 📡 **IoT Compliance Monitor**  
  Use sensors to track temperature, humidity, or movement. All data is handled in line with South Africa’s POPIA, so you can demo privacy principles without breaking the law.

- 🧠 **Responsible AI Node**  
  Run lightweight AI models on the Pi to score ESG metrics or flag ethical risks. Great for showing how AI can be transparent and accountable—even on a budget.

- 🔍 **Network Integrity Scanner**  
  Use Nmap and fail2ban to simulate a boardroom cybersecurity audit. It’s oddly satisfying watching your Pi block dodgy traffic while sipping your morning coffee.

- 📊 **ESG Dashboard Station**  
  Visualise governance metrics with Grafana and Node-RED. Ideal for SMEs who want to see their data without drowning in spreadsheets.

- 🧰 **LegalTech Kiosk**  
  Turn your Pi into a touchscreen interface for contract templates, governance FAQs, or stakeholder onboarding. It’s like a helpdesk in a box.

- 🛡️ **Pi-hole Privacy Gateway**  
  Block ads and trackers while demonstrating privacy-first infrastructure. POPIA-aligned and ICASA-aware.

### 🧵 What’s Inside  
- Modular code and wiring diagrams  
- Stakeholder-friendly documentation (yes, even for non-techies)  
- Badge trackers and learning paths for consultants and learners  
- GitHub Pages-ready templates for deployment and sharing  
- Notes on South African legislation (POPIA, ICASA) and global standards (GDPR, AI ethics)

### 🧠 Why It Matters  
In South Africa, governance isn’t just about ticking boxes—it’s about building trust, protecting people’s data, and making compliance something you *do*, not just something you *say*. These Raspberry Pi projects help bridge that gap.

They’re not just technical toys—they’re conversation starters, teaching tools, and proof-of-concept builds that show how governance can be hands-on, transparent, and even a little bit cool.

---

### 🚀 Who This Is For  
- Makers, hackers, and tinkerers who want to build with purpose  
- Legaltech and ESG professionals looking for practical demos  
- Educators and consultants who need stakeholder-friendly tools  
- Anyone who believes governance should be *visible*, *approachable*, and *real*

If you’ve ever wondered what POPIA looks like on a breadboard, or how AI ethics could be explained with blinking LEDs—this repo’s for you. Let’s build governance you can actually see.
